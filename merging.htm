      Merging
    </div>

    <div id="s-definition">
      Merging means combining the changes from one branch into another. It's a fundamental operation in Git that allows
      you to integrate different lines of development and bring work from feature branches back into the main codebase.
    </div>

    <div id="s-use-cases">
      <div><i class="fa-solid fa-wrench"></i> Use Cases:</div>
      <ul>
        <li>Integrating completed features into the main branch</li>
        <li>Combining bug fixes with the current codebase</li>
        <li>Synchronizing work from multiple developers</li>
        <li>Bringing experimental changes into production code</li>
        <li>Consolidating multiple commits with squash merge</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

      <h3>How to Merge</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <div>Switch to the branch you want to merge into (usually main):</div>
          <div class="code">git switch main</div>
        </li>

        <li>
          <div>Update your branch with the latest changes before merging:</div>
          <div class="code">git pull</div>
          <div>You should ensure that the branch you switched to is updated with the latest changes from the repo
            before merging.</div>
        </li>

        <li>
          <div>Merge a branch into your current branch:</div>
          <div class="code">git merge [target branch]</div>
          <div>This merges the "demo1" branch into your current branch.</div>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Squash Merging</h3>
      <div>
        <div>Squash merge is used if you want all changes from a specific branch to your current branch in a single
          commit.</div>
        <h4>How to Squash Merge</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Create a new branch and switch over.
          </li>
          <li>
            Make changes such as change text, add new files, etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            Commit those changes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Switch back to your main branch.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use git command:
            <div class="code">git merge --squash [target branch]</div>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <div>You may notice that this DID NOT merge together. It simply copied all the changes made in your new
          branch and pasted it in your main branch and then you can manually commit those changes in the main branch.
          This keeps the project history clean and easy to read.</div>
      </div>

      <h3>Abort Merging</h3>
      <div>
        <div>Aborting a merge will cancel a merge that is currently in progress and returns the repo to the
          state it was before the merge started.</div>
        <div class="code">git merge --abort</div>
        <div>This is handy if you have any issues during a merge like a conflict that you don't want to resolve.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
